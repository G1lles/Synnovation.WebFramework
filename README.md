# Synnovation Web Framework

The **Synnovation Web Framework** is a lightweight web framework built in **.NET 9**. This project was created as part of an assignment during my studies at **Karel de Grote University** to deepen my understanding of web framework development. The framework includes various features such as:

- Routing
- A middleware pipeline
- Controllers (supporting both MVC and REST)
- A custom view engine
- Parameter binding
- Integration with TailwindCSS
- And more!
